          React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about
          your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It
          designs simple views for each state in your application, and React
          will efficiently update and render just the right component when your
          data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable
          and easier to debug.

          A React application is made of multiple components, each responsible
          for rendering a small, reusable piece of HTML. Components can be
          nested within other components to allow complex applications to be
          built out of simple building blocks. A component may also maintain an
          internal state â€“ for example, a TabList component may store a variable
          corresponding to the currently open tab.

          Note: React is not a framework. It is just a library developed by
          Facebook to solve some problems that we were facing earlier.

        <Text>
          useEffect after render: We know that, the useEffect() is used for
          causing side effects in functional components and it is also capable
          for handling componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate() and
          componentWillUnmount() life-cycle methods of class based components
          into functional component.
